# Safe Free Mining Migration Checklist

## ‚úÖ Pre-Migration Safety Checks

### 1. **Database Backup**
```sql
-- Create a backup of your current database
-- This is CRITICAL before running any migration
```

### 2. **Check Current Tables**
```sql
-- Run this to see what tables currently exist
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
ORDER BY table_name;
```

### 3. **Check Current Functions**
```sql
-- Run this to see what functions currently exist
SELECT routine_name 
FROM information_schema.routines 
WHERE routine_schema = 'public' 
ORDER BY routine_name;
```

### 4. **Check User Count**
```sql
-- Run this to see how many users you have
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_users FROM users;
```

## üöÄ Safe Migration Steps

### Step 1: Run the Safe Migration
```sql
-- Execute: safe_free_mining_migration.sql
-- This will:
-- ‚úÖ Only create table if it doesn't exist
-- ‚úÖ Only create functions if they don't exist  
-- ‚úÖ Only add indexes if they don't exist
-- ‚úÖ Only enable RLS if not already enabled
-- ‚úÖ Only create policies if they don't exist
-- ‚úÖ Only initialize periods for users who don't have them
```

### Step 2: Verify Migration Success
```sql
-- Check if table was created
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM free_mining_periods;

-- Check if functions were created
SELECT routine_name FROM information_schema.routines 
WHERE routine_name LIKE '%free_mining%';

-- Check if users have periods
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_users,
    COUNT(fmp.user_id) as users_with_periods
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN free_mining_periods fmp ON u.id = fmp.user_id;
```

### Step 3: Test the Functions
```sql
-- Test with a specific user ID (replace 1 with actual user ID)
SELECT * FROM get_free_mining_status(1);
SELECT * FROM can_user_mine_free(1);
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è What Makes This Migration Safe

### ‚úÖ **No Data Loss**
- Does NOT drop existing tables
- Does NOT modify existing data
- Only adds new functionality

### ‚úÖ **Idempotent Operations**
- Can be run multiple times safely
- Uses `IF NOT EXISTS` checks
- Uses `CREATE OR REPLACE` for functions

### ‚úÖ **Backward Compatible**
- Existing code will continue to work
- New functionality is additive only
- No breaking changes to existing APIs

### ‚úÖ **Rollback Available**
- Complete rollback script provided
- Can revert all changes if needed
- No permanent modifications

## üîç What the Migration Does

### **For New Users**
- Creates free mining period on first login
- 100 days from account creation
- 100 sessions maximum

### **For Existing Users**
- Creates free mining period if they don't have one
- 100 days from account creation (or migration date if account is older)
- Preserves any existing mining activity

### **For All Users**
- Adds grace period (7 days after expiry)
- Better session tracking
- Enhanced status reporting

## üö® Emergency Rollback

If something goes wrong, run:
```sql
-- Execute: rollback_free_mining_migration.sql
-- This will completely remove the new system
```

## üìä Expected Results

After successful migration:
- ‚úÖ `free_mining_periods` table exists
- ‚úÖ 4 new functions created
- ‚úÖ All users have free mining periods
- ‚úÖ RLS policies active
- ‚úÖ Indexes created for performance

## üß™ Testing Checklist

- [ ] Migration runs without errors
- [ ] All users have free mining periods
- [ ] Functions return correct data
- [ ] UI shows proper status
- [ ] Mining start/stop works
- [ ] Session counting works
- [ ] Grace period logic works

## üìû Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the error messages
2. Verify database permissions
3. Run the verification queries
4. Use the rollback script if needed
5. Check the application logs

This migration is designed to be **completely safe** and **non-disruptive** to your existing system.
